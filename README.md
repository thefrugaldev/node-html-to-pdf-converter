# Node.js application using handlebars and puppeteer to create dynamic PDFs

To get started, in the project directory, you can run the following steps in order:

1. ### `yarn install`

Installs all dependencies needed for this project to run.

1. ### `node pdf-gen.js`

Runs the app in headless mode. Running this command will generate a PDF in the PDF directory. Open the newest file (they're sorted by date) generated by the application and you will see your newly created PDF :smile:
